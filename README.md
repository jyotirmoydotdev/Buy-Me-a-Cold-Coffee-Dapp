## About The Project

For this project, my primary objective was to design a user interface and smart contract that emulates the functionality of Buy Me a Coffee. To achieve this goal, I utilized several essential libraries, including React, Solidity, Thirdweb, and Foundry, among others.

### Contract Address on [Sepolia Testnet](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4cfed9e1aBA4E876E0f3bc096801792B5Dc940C8)
``` solidity
0x4cfed9e1aBA4E876E0f3bc096801792B5Dc940C8
